# AI-Spymasters-for-Codenames
For my final project for CSCI 3202 at CU, I worked on creating an AI spymaster for the board game Codenames. In the implementation, I used an alpha beta search and word embeddings from different Gensim libraries. I also used PyGame to display single games. 

My primary results are shown in the project writeup. The data I used are in the codenames_word text file. The full implementation is in codenames.py.
